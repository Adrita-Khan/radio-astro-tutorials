    "## Introduction\n",
    "Radio astronomy reveals objects that do not radiate in other parts of the spectrum, and they are able to pass through galactic dust clouds that obscure the view in the optical range. In continuum, radio sky is dominated by non-thermal emission, i.e. the emission which cannot be characterized by a single temperature. The non-thermal radio emission usually are sites of particle acceleration and produce synchrotron, Coherent emission, Masers emission. They also reveal new phenomenon such as Fast Radio Bursts etc. \n",

    "The angular resolution of a single radio antenna is insufficient for many astronomical purposes. For example, at 21cm, to obtain 1 arcsec resolution one needs 42km dish. Thus the concept is that for high resolution, use an antenna array instead of a single antenna. Signals from different antennas are brought to focus electronically. Now resolution is better since in resolution Î»/d, d is the largest separation between the antennas in the array. Imagine making an image with mirrors with holes. More antennas means lesser holes. \n",
